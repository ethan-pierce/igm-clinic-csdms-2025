Running ice dynamics models is difficult. Running ice dynamics models over geomorphic time scales is even more difficult! In this clinic, we show how the Instructed Glacier Model ([IGM](https://github.com/jouvetg/igm/tree/main/igm/modules))<sup>a</sup> can accelerate your models of glaciated landscapes.
